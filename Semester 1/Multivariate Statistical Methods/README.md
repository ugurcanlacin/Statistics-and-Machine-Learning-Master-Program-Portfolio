# Multivariate Statistical Methods

In this course, I, [Milda Poceviciute](https://github.com/poceviciute) , [Henrik Karlsson](https://github.com/henkar91)  and [Ramon Laborda](https://github.com/ramonlaborda) had 4 lab projects that we had to implement everything in R programming language. You can see below briefly what each project contains.

## What I learned from this course?

Since I have a software engineering bachelors degree, I had no idea how to interpret the data in statistical way. Perhaps I could lead to some inferences by using some software libraries. But I think I have gained a much better understanding by having its background mathematically. In order to be able to develop this successful machine learning model, it is necessary to first understand data itself. With this course I have gained a good experience on the way of understanding the multi variable data.

During lab projects, I have reached the following goals by using R programming language.

- Used various plots to understand data from different approaches visually.
- Applied distance methods to see outliers.
- Compared mean vectors by finding their confidence intervals-regions, and applying one-way MANOVA to see how mean vectors differ. It is necessary because mean vectors may have close values, but confidence regions and MANOVA analysis explain more about data.
- Applied PCA to reduce dimension of data. In some cases, we may have huge dimension like DNA features. In that case, applying plots or mean vector analysis are not helpful. So, PCA is applicable to reduce dimension of that data. 


## Labs

[Lab 1](Multivariate%20Assignment%201/)

- The first step in data analysis is examination of raw data. In this lab, We applied various plots to understand data from different approaches.
- Had practice for covariance and correlation matrices according to data.
- Examining extreme values by applying Euclidean and Mahalanobis methods.

[Lab 2](Multivariate%20Assignment%202/)

- Test of outliers by helping of Mahalanobis method.
- Test confidence region and confidence interval for a mean vector
- Comparison of mean vectors (one-way MANOVA)


[Lab 3](Multivariate%20Assignment%203/)

- Applied Principal Component Analysis to see how we can reduce the dimesion.
- Factor analysis


[Lab 4](Multivariate%20Assignment%204/)

- Canonical correlation analysis
