# Multivariate Statistical Methods

In this course, I, [Milda Poceviciute](https://github.com/poceviciute) , [Henrik Karlsson](https://github.com/henkar91)  and [Ramon Laborda](https://github.com/ramonlaborda) had 4 lab projects that we had to implement everything in R programming language. You can see below briefly what each project contains.

## Labs

[Lab 1](Multivariate%20Assignment%201/)

- The first step in data analysis is examination of raw data. In this lab, We applied various plots to understand data from different approaches.
- Had practice for covariance and correlation matrices according to data.
- Examining extreme values by applying Euclidean and Mahalanobis methods.

[Lab 2](Multivariate%20Assignment%202/)

- Test of outliers by helping of Mahalanobis method.
- Test confidence region and confidence interval for a mean vector
- Comparison of mean vectors (one-way MANOVA)


[Lab 3](Multivariate%20Assignment%203/)

- Principal components
- Factor analysis


[Lab 4](Multivariate%20Assignment%204/)

- Canonical correlation analysis
