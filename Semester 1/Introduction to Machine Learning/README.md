# Introduction to Machine Learning

In this course, I, [Milda Poceviciute](https://github.com/poceviciute) and [Henrik Karlsson](https://github.com/henkar91) had 5 lab projects that we had to implement everything in R programming language. Group members were supposed to do each lab own their own and at the end put entire work into a report by choosing best explanations. We have implemented some algorithms to solve a wide variety of machine learning problems. Sometimes we used packages but played with their parameters to understand problems.

## What I learned from this course?

I have learned so much things in this course, so I will write down everything which I think it is useful. It is also helpful to remind me whenever I need.

- Lab 1
In this lab, we were asked to solve 3 assignments, which are about K-NN Algorithm, Cross Validation, Linear Regression and Regularization.

-- Assignment 1
We are given spambase.xlsx data set which contains information about the frequency of various words, characters etc for a total of 2740 e-mails. These emails have been manually classified as spams or regular emails. The assignment wanted us to build spam filter model by using K-NN algorithm. 
- We implemented that algorithm to achieve our goal. 
- We tried different K parameters and compared misclassification rates.
- We also tried kknn() package for same purpose and compared result with previous steps.
- We analyzed ROC curves and sensitivity and specifity.
