# Introduction to Machine Learning

In this course, I, [Milda Poceviciute](https://github.com/poceviciute) , [Henrik Karlsson](https://github.com/henkar91) had 5 lab projects that we had to implement everything in R programming language. Each group member was supposed to do each lab own their own and at the end put entire work into a report. We have implemented some algorithms to solve a wide variety of machine learning problems. Sometimes we used packages but played with their parameters to understand problems.

You can see below briefly what each project contains.
