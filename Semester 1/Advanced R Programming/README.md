# Advanced R Programming

In this course, I had 7 lab projects that I had to implement everything in R programming language. You can see below briefly what each project contains.

## What I learned from this course?

When I started this program, I had already software development experience but never touched R before. So, It was not hard for me to integrate it myself. During lab project, I have reached the following goals by using R programming language and best practices.

- Object-oriented development structure in R
- Package creation in R language
- Buil-Fail tracking of packages via Travis CI
- Writing unit tests
- Writing both code and user documentations
- Data processing via web APIs by applying various packages
- Implementations of many mathematical and statistical operations

## Labs

[Lab 1](Lab%201/)

- Implemented given instructions which contain mathematical operations, vector, matrix, data frame, list, basic statistics.

[Lab 2](Lab%202/)

- Implemented given instructions which ask to use following statements: if-else,for loop, while loop, functions, repeat, break, stop, environment checking.

[Lab 3](Lab%203/)

- Created first R package in R. Implemented Euclidean and Dijkstra algorithms.
- Used roxygen2 for code documentation.
- Included test suits.
- Integrated TravisCI.

[Lab 4](Lab%204/)

- Calculated regressions coefficients, fitted values, residuals, degrees of freedom, residual variance, variance of the regression coefficients, - t-values for each coefficient.
- Implemented class and methods.
- Added unit tests.
- Used vignette for user documentation.
- Created custom theme for graphs.
- Integrated TravisCI.

[Lab 5](Lab%205/)

- Created a package connecting to NASA API.
- Implemented some statistics analysis by using asteroid data source.
- Implemented class and methods.
- Added unit tests.
- Used vignette for user documentation.
- Integrated TravisCI.

[Lab 6](Lab%206/)

- Used three algorithms to solve Knapsack problem, such as, brute force, greedy knapsack and knapsack dynamic.
- Added unit tests.
- Used vignette for user documentation.
- Integrated TravisCI.

[Lab 7](Lab%207/)

- Used dplyr, ggplot2, caret packages.
- Implemented linear regression method.
- Made predictions by using implemented ridgereg function.
- Added unit tests.
- Used vignette for user documentation.
- Integrated TravisCI.
