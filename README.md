# Statistics and Machine Learning Master Program Portfolio

I am Ugurcan Lacin and doing a Masters’ degree in Statistics and Machine Learning in Linköping University. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. 

I am taking courses each period and doing lots of lab projects. I will clearly be sharing all the lab reports, source code, data sets, and instruction files that I have done for the courses after every period is done.

You can find each course below and when you go to course, you will see many folders. Each folder represents a lab. Each lab has a instruction file and solutions for that instructions. Solutions are presented as PDF file and generated from R Markdown. 80% of this master uses R programming language. So, the content is mostly R.
