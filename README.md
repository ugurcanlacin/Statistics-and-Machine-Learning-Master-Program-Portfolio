# Statistics and Machine Learning Master Program Portfolio

I am Ugurcan Lacin and doing a Masters’ degree in Statistics and Data Mining in Linköping University. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. 

I am taking courses each period and doing lots of lab projects. I will clearly be sharing all the lab reports, source code, data sets, and instruction files that I have done for the courses after every period is done.
